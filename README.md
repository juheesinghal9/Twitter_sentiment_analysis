Twitter Sentiment Analysis 

This repository uses twint package to get back data from twitter. Twitter APIs has restriction, we can only get data upto specific dates (currently max 30 days). 
Drawback of using twint is that this is forked from a git repository, so any changes on twitter (front end, API, restriction will break the code), that has to be resolved using google. 

Sentiment_Analysis is basic file, that gets the data and return positive, negative and neutral sentiments
